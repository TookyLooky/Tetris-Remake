# About the project

I followed multiple tutorials on builing games with c++ and raylib. As this is my first game made with raylib and c++ it took me quit a while to figure out how everything works. This project is begginer level and should not be taken serious

# Remarks

I did not add "make file" and json files, because it would take me a long time to clean my private information from it

# Where to play the game?

You can play this game on itch.io or download the executable file there

## Link for the game

## Thank You
